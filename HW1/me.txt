Hi! I'm Jade Law! I'm a first year computer science major at Georgia Institute of Technology. I like to listen to music and play music during my free time. I also enjoy writing, reading, watching Netflix or just zoning out. I haven't had a lot of programming experience, but I hope to get more comfortable coding and learn more languages.
